# 3.5.5-Packet-Tracer---Configure-DTP

Objectives
=   Configure static trunking

=   Configure and Verify DTP

Background / Scenario
As the number of switches in a network increases, the administration necessary to manage the VLANs and trunks can be challenging. To ease some of the VLAN and trunking configurations, trunk negotiation between network devices is managed by the Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP), and is automatically enabled on Catalyst 2960 and Catalyst 3650 switches.

In this activity, you will configure trunk links between the switches. You will assign ports to VLANs and verify end-to-end connectivity between hosts in the same VLAN. You will configure trunk links between the switches, and you will configure VLAN 999 as the native VLAN.
